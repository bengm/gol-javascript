== README

I decided to make a version of Conway's Game of Life during DCamp 2014. 

The app happens to be in Rails - but there is no ruby/rails code upon which the app relies.

===Features:
* Play/pause the game
* Randomly seed the board
* Click to toggle cells as live/dead
* Change the rules of the game in-flight
