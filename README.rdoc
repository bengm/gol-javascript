I decided to make a version of Conway's Game of Life during DCamp 2014. 

The app happens to be in Rails - but there is no ruby/rails code upon which the app relies.

Features:
 - Play/pause the game
 - Randomly seed the board
 - Click to toggle cells as live/dead
 - Change the rules of the game in-flight
